## About the project:

Without any doubt it was a challenging project, pulling me to go even deeper into some Flutter concepts.

While I was executing the tasks of this test, I was imagining it as a daily task, and because I am doing it in the middle of the weekend, because on weekdays I don't have much time to perform additional tasks, it made me realize how much I like to Flutter and developing for mobile devices, and that undoubtedly, making this a daily routine would be rewarding.

Thanks to everyone at Cheesecake Labs for approving me to take this technical test. I know I have a lot to learn and it would be an honor to learn from you guys.

PS: if you notice the functionality to mark as unread this is included in the longPress of the ListTile itself.
